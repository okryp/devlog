            <p>
                Wrote my first working haskell program. It's a simple program that takes an integer input from the user,
                and checks if it is the same forwards as it is reversed. A "palindrome check" so to speak.
                <br>
                The program asks the user for an input, and returns the number reversed and True/False based on if it's a
                palindrome or not.
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        reverseInt :: Integer -> Integer<br>
                        reverseInt = read . reverse. show<br>
                        <br>
                        compareInt :: Integer -> Integer -> Bool<br>
                        compareInt x rx = x == rx<br>
                        <br>
                        main :: IO()<br>
                        main = do<br>
                        putStrLn "Hello! Input integer: "<br>
                        input <- getLine<br>
                        let i = read input :: Integer<br>
                        putStr (show (reverseInt i))<br>
                        <br>
                        putStrLn "\nIs it the same?"<br>
                        putStr (show (compareInt i (reverseInt i)))<br>
                    </code>    
                </div>
                <br>
                If you enter the number 121, it will put in stdout "121" and "True" as it is the same forwards and backwards.
                However if you were to enter a number such as 123, it would return "321" and "False" as it is not the same. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                After making the previous code i figured out how to combine the compareInt function with the reverseInt function
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        -- Palindrome Check v2 ---<br>
                        palindromeCheck :: Integer -> Bool<br>
                        palindromeCheck x = x == (read.reverse.show) x<br>
                        <br>
                        main :: IO()<br>
                        main = do<br>
                            putStrLn "Hello again! Input integer to check"<br>
                            input <- getLine<br>
                            let inputInt = read input :: Integer<br>
                            <br>
                            putStr (show (palindromeCheck inputInt))<br>
                    </code>    
                </div>
                <br>
                The code now takes the Integer provided by the user, and returns a boolean based on said input. The function
                palindromeCheck takes the Integer and compares it with the reversed integer in a oneliner of combined functions
                that are provided in base Haskell.

                <h3>Learning, not by "trial by fire"</h3>
                Continuing my work in Haskell, i have decided to follow along with a youtube guide for imperative programmers
                made by Phillipp Hagenlocher. I have reached episode 5 where he tasks the viewer with completing a series
                of exercises with lists.
                <br>
                I have completed the first of these exercises with some help to the notes i've been taking along with watching
                the playlist.
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        -- Create a function "elem" tat returns True if an element is in a given list<br> 
                        -- and returns False otherwise<br>
                        elem :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool<br>
                        elem _ [] = False<br>
                        elem x xs<br>
                            | x == last xs = True<br>
                            | otherwise    = elem x (init xs)<br>

                <br>
                The function types have been provided by Phillip and contain something that will be explained in a later
                episode in the series.
                <br>
                The code I have written takes 2 argumens: a variable, and an array of variables. If the array provided is
                empty the function automatically returns False. If the function is not empty and the last element of the 
                list is equal to the first argument provided, it returns true. Otherwise, the function recurses with the 
                same initial arguments, however the last item in the list has been removed by the init function which is 
                built in Haskell and has been explained in a previous episode of the series. 
                <br><br>
                The following exercise was a function that removed any duplicate numbers out of a given list.
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        -- Create a function "nub" that removes all duplicates from a given list<br>
                        nub :: (Eq a) => [a] -> [a]<br>
                        nub [] = []<br>
                        nub (x:xs)<br>
                            | elem x xs = nub xs<br>
                            | otherwise   = x : nub xs<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <br>
                This function returns an empty array if the array put in is an empty array. Otherwise, It makes use of 
                the elem function described above tho check if the element is in the array, if not, it gets appended to 
                the new list, otherwise the list without it gets run through the function again.  
                <br><br>
                The following exercise is a function that checks if the list provided goes in ascending order.
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        -- Create a function isAsc that returns True if the list given to it is a list<br> 
                        -- of ascending order<br>
                        isAsc :: [Int] -> Bool<br>
                        isAsc [] = True<br>
                        isAsc (x:xs)<br>
                            | null xs = True<br>
                            | x <= head xs = isAsc xs<br>
                            | otherwise = False<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <br>
                This function goes through the list checking if the current element is smaller or equal to the next 
                element (accessed by checking the head of the rest of the list). If it is smaller than the following 
                number, the function continues to iterate over and over until the list is empty and returns True. If a 
                number is found that is larger than the following, it returns false as it is no longer in ascending 
                order.
                <br>
                The exercise solution is a bit of a dirty trick pulled by the creator, using a technique that has not 
                been discussed yet. The solution shows that you can have multiple elements in the (x:xs) notation, as 
                long as there are enough items in the list to support it, or that in case there are less, a different 
                guard covers it. In the solution the creator used<br>isAsc (x:y:xs) = (x <= y) && (y:xs)<br>which 
                results in the list getting shorter and shorter until it reaches the length of one element which returns
                True.
                <br><br>
                The last exercise of the episode is one that concerns directed graphs displayed in 2 integer tuples. The
                exercise asks to create a function that takes an list of these tuples, and 2 integers as nodes which it
                then uses to check if they are connected from node 1 to node 2 with the help of the tuple list.
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        -- Create a function hasPath that determines if a path from one node to another<br>
                        -- exists withit a directed graph<br>
                        hasPath :: [(Int, Int)] -> Int -> Int -> Bool<br>
                        hasPath xs x y<br>
                            | x == y = True<br>
                            | x > y && elem1 (x, x-1) xs= hasPath xs (x-1) y<br>
                            | x < y && elem1 (x, x+1) xs= hasPath xs (x+1) y<br>
                            | otherwise = False<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <br>
                The function takes the list of tuples and 2 other integers, and goes node by node checking if there is a
                valid further node to go to. If said node exists, go to that node until x is equal to y which means the 
                path is valid. If the further node doesn't exist, the path is impossibe, and returns False
