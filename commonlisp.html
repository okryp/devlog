            <p>
                Decided to check out what the fuss was about with the lisp family of languages. For this I decided to go
                with Common Lisp as it seems to be the closest thing to bare bones lisp. I've heard that clojure is the 
                most popular out of the lisp family, but i have no intention of working with the JVM.
                <br>
                The first proper function i've written is a recursive factorial function. It returns the factorial of 
                the value entered. No error handling as i still have to figure that out.
                <br><br>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <code>
                        (defun factorial (n)<br>
                            (if (<= n 1)<br>
                                  1<br>
                                (* n (factorial (- n 1)))<br>
                              )<br>
                          )<br>
                    </code>
                </div>
                <br>
                The most interesting part of writing lisp code is that the operator comes first in a statement such as 
                2 + 2. This would be written (+ 2 2). This is because lisp interprets everything between parentheses as 
                a list, and interprets lists with an operator in the front as a function. This means that you can add 
                all items in a list like this (+ 1 2 3) => 6.
                <br>
                I look forward to experiment more in this ancient language.
